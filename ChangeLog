version 0.17.8: pure bugfix: the wrong version of gmp was packaged;
	must be 6.1.1 by now
version 0.17.7: fixed a bug in SPXinterface.cc where a new[] had a
	non-matching delete
	modernized autoconf/automake initialization
	updated gmp to version 6.1.1
version 0.17.6: added a command line option that allows only balanced flips
version 0.17.5: renamed the static "nullptr()" method for SmartPtr<T>
	to "smartnullptr()" because the standard literal "nullptr" is
	implemented as a macro in gcc-4.2.1 such that the declaration of
	"nullptr()" in class SmartPtr<T> gets corrupted
	forced "$libdir" in "external" to "lib" in order to avoid problems
	with autoconf installations that use lib64 on 64-bit systems and 
	multi-binary systems (no harm here because the installation of
	externals is done only local inside the TOPCOM build tree)
	removed usage of unordered_set/map altogether because of differing
	include paths of different compilers
	for that same reason, the profiling tool "bench" was removed from
	the distribution 
version 0.17.4: gmpxx.h is now overloaded by a version that canonicalizes
	all rational input data right away
version 0.17.3: updated to gmp-5.0.5
	since "0/5 != 0" in mpq_class (gmp), 
	introduced a special "is_zero" test for Rationals
	that only uses the numerator
version 0.17.2: correction of a syntax issue with gcc 4.7
	update of the address of the FSF in COPYING and README
	(thanks to the Fedora team for the report!)
version 0.17.1: correction of read from input stream in Facets.hh
	ID for triangulations allowing for an option to output flip edges
version 0.17.0: new function to construct Birkhoff subpolytopes
	new function to transform point configuration to full rank
	representation (carefull: this may change normalized volumes)
version 0.16.4: updated alternative STL structures to modern gcc
	added command line option "--reportfrequency [n]" with the meaning
	that every [n]th new triangulation triggers a report to stderr
version 0.16.3: changed shell command for external builds from csh to sh
	output heights in terms of exact fractions not doubles
version 0.16.2: external includes/libs are now allways taken from
	external/include resp. external/lib
version 0.16.1: improved automatic build of external packages gmp and cdd
	vanilla-cdd function "dd_free_global_constants" is now used
	instead of "dd_clear_global_constants"
version 0.16.0: dumped polymake wrappers and switched to gmpxx wrappers
version 0.15.4: updated documentation
version 0.15.3: fixed dump file processing
version 0.15.2: removed extra qualification "__is_const_iterator::" and similar
	fixed dump support by adding "clear()" at the beginning of parsing hash tables
version 0.15.1: patched cdd because of memory leak
version 0.15.0: new commandline option "--nonregular": it triggers an output filter
	so that only the nonregular triangulations are output.  As opposed to
	"--regular" it does not reduce the number of triangulations explored;
	provided some new clients for points that have been there already for chirotopes
	updated to gmp-4.2.1 and cddlib-0.94b
version 0.14.0: first version that compiles on gcc4
	chiro2* returns an error now if --regular is given as an option 
	(regularity is not a well-defined concept without coordinates)
version 0.13.3: corrections in template specializations
	new generator for hypersimplices
	new examples
version 0.13.2: corrections in the usage message
	automake 1.7 adaptions
	corrected a bug that made the computation of the closure
	of the symmetry generators slow (gcc should not have compiled
	the old code since it contained a const bug)
version 0.13.1: automated the installation of external packages 
	gmp and cddlib in external by the configure script
	automatic detection of soplex and addition to the set
	of libraries in LIBS
version 0.13.0: new command line options
	--soplex : use soplex for regularity check (unstable)
	--nosym  : ignore symmetries
	--heights: output height vector for every regular triangulation
	           (requires --regular as well)
	corrected a bug causing regularity check being called 
	unnecessarily often
	patched gmp wrappers so that there is some chance that
	the package compiles under gcc 2.95 (only checked on PPC)
version 0.12.1: new interface to soplex
	(be aware that regularity checks using soplex
	maybe incorrect because of numerical problems)
version 0.12.0b: bug fix release: 0.12.0 mistakenly required soplex
version 0.12.0: compatibility to gcc3.2
version 0.11.1: correction of an error in the distribution (tweaks.h was missing)
	default is again to use uncompressed integer sets
version 0.11.0: new gmp wrappers from the polymake team
	added commandline options to reduce the number of points
	and to check regularity in fixed frequencies
	added support for the use of a compressed integer set
	stucture in simplicial complexes
version 0.10.2: added new commandline options for 
	checking regularity at a fixed frequency 
	reducing flips to vertex-removing flips
	forbidding vertex-inserting flips
	upgraded to automake 1.5
version 0.10.1: Replaced the use of HashSet by STL set for relatively small sets
	hash function uses multiplication instead of xor again
	(reduces chaining in large sets considerably).
	Introduced an invariant for bitsets to speed up negative equality check
	and pseudo-lexicographic comparison.
	Simplified hash function for IntegerSets and SimplicialComplexes by exploiting
	the invariant.
	Accellerated the IntegerSet iterator by using byte tables for 
	first set bit and nunber of set bits.
	Introduced compiler flags to replace some container structures by STL standard
	containers; fastest setting at the time being is `-DSTL_SYMMETRIES' since the
	only relevant operations for symmetries are
	constant iteration and iterator dereferencing, which is faster in 
	ordered sets than in HashSets.
version 0.10.0: Incorporated cddlib and a commandline option to count only 
	regular triangulations.
version 0.9.3: Updated for gcc3: mainly additions of `std::'.
	Replaced lrand48() by random() for the universal randomized
	hashing because MacOSX-gcc-stdlib does not contain lrand48().
	Removed explicit template instantiation because that does not work
	on all systems (thanks Ulrich Kortenkamp for reports on installing
	TOPCOM on MacOSX).
version 0.9.2: Bug fixes: removed and attempt to overload `xor'.
	Removed some offending friend declarations in definitons
	of internal classes.  Added a commandline parameter `-no <n>'
	specifying that only triangulations with exactly n simplices
	are considered.
version 0.9.1: Added a program `lattice m n' to compute the point
	configuration of all lattice points in the rectangle [0,0], [m,0],
	[0,n], [m,n]. Added `chiro2[n]allfinetriangs'.  Added `triangs'
	with new command line parameters in order to eventually reduce the
	number of binaries in the TOPCOM package
version 0.9.0: Adapted to gmp-3.1 with the help of polymake.
	Field is now a synonym of Rational, i.e., 
	the possibility of choosing double arithmetic
	was removed.
	Fixed a bug in cyclic.cc that produced too large coordinates
	(submitted by Julian Pfeifle).
version 0.5.6: Fixed a bug in wrap-gmp/Makefile.am: 
	include path pointed to wrong version of gmp.
version 0.5.5: 
	Fixed a bug in VirtualChiro.cc that caused
 	segfaults in chiro2[n]triangs
Version 0.5.4:
	Minor changes in the documentation files and comments.
	For details concerning the Santos triangulation see
	Francisco Santos' paper
	
		``A Point Set whose Space of Triangulations is Disconnected''
		Journal of the American Mathematical Society, to appear.
Version 0.5.3:
	Minor changes in the documentation files and comments
Version 0.5.2:
	Bugfix in santos_triang
Version 0.5.1:
	added points2flips, points2nflips: 
	computes only the flips of the seed triangulation.  

	The commands
 	{chiro,points}2{[n][fine]triangs} 
	accept a seed triangulation given by the user.
 	added some command line options
	-m:  try to comsume less memory
	-c:  check the seed triangulation given by the user
	-cc <n>:  set the chirotope cache size to <n> bases.
	-v:  verbose

	The famous brandnew triangulation without flips constructed
	recently by Francisco Santos is now included in the examples
	directory
 	(courtesy of Francisco Santos).

	Moreover, there is a program `santos_triang' that computes the
	input data of the Santos triangulation for TOPCOM.  With this
	equipment everybody should be able to check that spectacular
	result by typing the command santos_triang | points2nflips -v -c
	-m and waiting like ten minutes.
Version 0.4.0: 
	added points2triangs, points2ntriangs,
	points2finetriangs, points2nfinetriangs,
 	points2placingtriang, points2finetriang: 
	commands computing the data from the point set
 	by constructing its chirotope on the fly (lazy evaluation).
Version 0.3.0:
	added chiro2finetriang, chiro2finetriangs, chiro2nfinetriangs:
	commands providing only triangulations using all vertices
	verbosity is controlled via commandline option -v
Version 0.2.0:
	changed representation of flips
Version 0.1.3:
	replaced libg++ arithmetics by libgmp plus polymake wrappers
	(courtesy of E. Gawrilov and M. Joswig)
Version 0.1.2:
	removed dfschiro2ntriangs from the distribution
Version 0.1.1: 
	the point [0, ..., 0] is now rejected 
	added dfschiro2ntriangs; might save memory over chiro2ntriangs
Version 0.1:
	first distributed version
