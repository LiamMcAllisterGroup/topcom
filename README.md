# TOPCOM: Triangulations of Point Configurations and Oriented Matroids
#### Modified Version 1.1.2 for CYTools

A modified version of the [TOPCOM](https://www.wm.uni-bayreuth.de/de/team/rambau_joerg/TOPCOM/index.html) package that is used for the [CYTools](https://cy.tools) package. TOPCOM was originally written by [JÃ¶rg Rambau](https://www.wm.uni-bayreuth.de/de/team/rambau_joerg/index.php) and it was packaged for Debian by [Doug Torrance](https://webwork.piedmont.edu/~dtorrance/). This repository is a fork of the [TOPCOM Debian repository](https://salsa.debian.org/science-team/topcom).

This version of TOPCOM is modified very slightly so that it outputs the neighboring triangulations when asked for the flips of a triangulation. Older version of this modified package contained additional functionality, but they are no longer used in CYTools.
