See the file INSTALL for generic installation instructions.


IMPORTANT: 

(1) You need at least gcc3.0 to build this package.

(2) TOPCOM as of version 0.11.0 or higher uses gmp verson 4.1.  If you don't have
gmp version 4.1 or higher a copy of gmp-4.1 is included.  See the file INSTALL
for instructions how to build and install gmp-4.1 locally.

(3) On some installations of Linux the linker flag `-static' must be added in
src/Makefile.am.  Otherwise one might get undefined references from the stdc++ 
library.  Unfortunately, some systems do not allow the `-static' flag.  Since it
mostly works without this flag, the default is not to have it set.
