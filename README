See the file INSTALL for generic installation instructions.


IMPORTANT: 

(1) The package should compile just find on systems with a not too old gcc that supports
the c++17 standard. Apple silicon with clang should work as well.

(2) The functionality of TOPCOM has been integrated to a large extent into SAGEMATH.
People who do not want to fiddle with commandline tools may want to have a look there.
