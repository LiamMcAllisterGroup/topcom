TOPCOM for Debian
-----------------

We make several changes to the upstream package.

* Because of possible clashes with other packages in Debian due to common
  names (e.g., cube and cross), the prefix "topcom-" has been added to
  each of the binaries.  This is consistent with several other mathematical
  packages in Debian, e.g., 4ti2 and nauty.

* Upstream ships tarballs for the gmp and cdd libraries and always uses them
  when building TOPCOM.  We use a repacked tarball without these librarise
  and instead build with the corresponding Debian packages.

* We have added manpages, adapted from those written by Jerry James
  <loganjerry@gmail.com> using text from the sources for the Fedora package
  of TOPCOM.  In addition to adding the "topcom-" prefix where appropriate,
  we also insert the upstream version number during build instead of
  hardcoding it.

* The TOPCOM manual is not included in the source, but is available online:
