TOPCOM for Debian
-----------------

We make several changes to the upstream package.

* Because of possible clashes with other packages in Debian due to common
  names (e.g., cube and cross), the prefix "topcom-" has been added to
  each of the binaries.  This is consistent with several other mathematical
  packages in Debian, e.g., 4ti2 and nauty.

* Upstream ships tarballs for the gmp and cdd libraries and always uses them
  when building TOPCOM.  We use a repacked tarball without these librarise
  and instead build with the corresponding Debian packages.

* We have added manpages, adapted from those written by Jerry James
  <loganjerry@gmail.com> using text from the sources for the Fedora package
  of TOPCOM.  In addition to adding the "topcom-" prefix where appropriate,
  we also insert the upstream version number during build instead of
  hardcoding it.

* The TOPCOM manual is not included in the source, but is available online:

TOPCOM Mod for CYTools
----------------------

This version of TOPCOM contains additional functionality compared to the
original one. In particular, it has the ability to perform random walks in the
graph of triangulations by performing random flips, and it can compute
$$\mathcal{K}_\cup$$ (i.e. the union of the KÃ¤hler cones of toric varieties
containing a particular Calabi-Yau hypersurface that is unchanged under the
transition to any of those varieties). These tools can be used with the
binaries ```topcom-randomwalk``` and ```topcom-computekcup```.
