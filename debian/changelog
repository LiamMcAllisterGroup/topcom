topcom (1.1.1+ds-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release.
  * debian/clean
    - Stop cleaning generated TeX manual files.
    - Start cleaning generated manpage files.
  * debian/clean
    - Add libqsopt-ex-dev to Build-Depends; new optional dependency for
      regularity checks.
    - Add libbz2-dev and zlib1g-dev to Build-Depends; used by QSopt_ex.
    - Add txt2man to Build-Depends; now used to generate manpage.
    - Remove texlive-* from Build-Depends since we no longer build the
      manual.
  * debian/libtopcom-dev.install
    - Install new pkg-config file.
  * debian/man
    - Remove directory.  To simplify maintenance, we now use a single
      manpage (with symlinks) instead of individual manpages for each
      command.
  * debian/manual.tex
    - Remove file.  This was the manual for a much older version of TOPCOM.
  * debian/patches/fix-32-bit-build.patch
    - New patch; avoid "cannot be overloaded" compiler errors on 32-bit
      systems.
  * debian/patches/no-csh.patch
    - Remove patch; no longer necessary.
  * debian/patches/pkg-config.patch
    - New patch; add pkg-config file.
  * debian/patches/*

    - Update section about manual.  We now give a link to the online version.
  * debian/rules
    - Pass new --enable-qsoptex option to configure script.
    - Update execute_before_dh_installman target; instead of injecting the
      version numbers into dozens of individual manpages, we now build a
      single manpage using txt2man.
    - Add override_dh_link target to create symlinks to new manpage for
      each of the many TOPCOM commands.
  * debian/tests/control
    - Update library-test to use new pkg-config file.
  * debian/topcom.doc-base
    - Remove file; no longer needed as we no longer ship the manual.
  * debian/topcom.docs
    - Stop installing manual.
  * debian/topcom.manpages
    - Stop installing individual *.1 manpages; they are now created as
      symlinks by dh_link.
    - Update path to topcom.7.
  * debian/topcom.pc.in
    - Add pkg-config file; processed by configure to generate topcom.pc.
  * debian/topcom.txt
    - Add new manpage; processed by txt2man to generate topcom.7.
