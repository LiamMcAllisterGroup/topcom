Description: Triangulations Of Point Configurations and Oriented Matroids
 TOPCOM is a collection of clients to compute Triangulations Of Point
 Configurations and Oriented Matroids, resp.
 .
 The algorithms use only combinatorial data of the point configuration
 as is given by its oriented matroid. Some basic commands for computing
 and manipulating oriented matroids can also be accessed by the user.
 .
 It was very much inspired by the maple program PUNTOS, which was
 written by Jesus de Loera. TOPCOM is entirely written in C++, so there
 is a significant speed up compared to PUNTOS.
